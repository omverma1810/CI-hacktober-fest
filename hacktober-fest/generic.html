                <p>Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing
                    to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prepare and share your project for collaboration</li>
                    <li>Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests</li>
                    <li>Organize an event</li>
                    <li>Mentor others</li>
                    <li>Donate directly to open source projects</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><b><u>From Us!</u></b></h2>
                <p>" Welcome Software Geeks, Let's expand our open source community and help each other to grow. Everyone who has an interest in contributing to Open Source Softwares and Projects, and those who want to increase their networking can join
                    this group." In this event, we are going to contribute to open-source software via GitHub or GitLab as per personal preference. Please make sure that you have registered your GitHub or GitLab account on the Hacktoberfest website. We
                    highly recommend using GitHub for the registration. You just need to make a pull request on the GitHub repository you want and if the maintainer of that repository accepts your pull request by giving the tag - "hacktoberfest-accepted"
                    then your pull request will be counted as a valid request and you have to make at least four(4) pull request to qualify. After that, if you are in the first 50,000 contributors then you will receive a T-shirt and Stickers as developer
                    Swag by Digital Ocean. For more information kindly visit Hacktoberfest 2021 official website. This event will begin on October 1, 2021, and end on October 31, 2021. Looking forward to seeing you in our community. Thank You.</p>
